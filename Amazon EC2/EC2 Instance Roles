# Using EC2 Instance Connect

Let's use EC2 Instance Connect and try to run some aws commands

1. If we run command `aws iam list-users`, it throws an error saying `Unable to locate credentials.`
2. We can setup our access keys in aws console but it is a bad practice to setup access keys in EC2 instances it will be visible to other users operating the account as well.
3. To solve this issue, we create an IAM role for the EC2 instance that has `IAMReadOnlyAccess`. This role gives the instance the permission to read the IAM user details.
4. Go to `Instance` > `Action` > `Security` > `Modify IAM Role` > `Choose an IAM Role`
