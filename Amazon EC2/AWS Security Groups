# Security Groups

1. These are fundamentals of network security in AWS.
2. They control how traffic is allowed in or out of our EC2 instances.
3. Security Groups only contain allow rules.
4. Security groups rules can reference by IP or security group.

# Security Groups Controls

As the security groups acts as a firewall, it regulates  the folowing aspects:

1. Access to ports
2. Authorized IP ranges
3. Control of Inbound network
4. Control of outbound network

# Some points to remember  

1. Security Groups can be attached to multiple instances and also one instance can have multiple security groups too.
2. Locked down to a region.(Region specific)
3. Security Groups are different entity then EC2 instances, In case some connections are blocked, EC2 instances will have no idea or log about it.
4. If the application is not accessibe or says `Timed Out`, it is probably a security group issue.
5. If the application gives errors like `Connection Refused`, it's an application error.
6. By default all inbound traffics are blocked and all outbound traffic are allowed.

# How to reference Security Groups from other Security Groups?

If we just configure our `Security Group X` with an instance to allow inbound connections from `Security Group A` and `Security Group B`, then the instances with Security Group A and B can make connections with the former instance. Consequently any other instance having other Security Group say C will not be able to connect with that instance.

# Ports to Know (for Exam Purpose)

22 -> SSH (Secure Shell) - Log in to Linux instance
21 -> FTP (File Trandfer Protocol) - Upload files in file share
22 -> SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files through SSH
80 -> HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) - Connect unsecured websites
443 -> HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) - Connect secured websites
3389 -> RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - Log in to Windows instance
