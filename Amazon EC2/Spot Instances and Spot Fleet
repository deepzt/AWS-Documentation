# How to terminate spot instances?

We need to understand spot requests. Using spot requests, we are defining the following things:

- Maximum price
- Lauch specification 
- Desired type of instance
- Request type: One-Time | Persistant
- Valid From, Valid Untill

So, there are two types of spot requests:

- One time request -> Once the spot instances are deployed the request ends.
- Persistant request -> Even if the instances are stopped, the requests kicks in and demands for the instances again given it is in the valid time period.

So in case of persistant request, we need to cancel the request and then terminate the spot instances.

In case we terminate the spot instances first, the requests will kick in and AWS is going to deploy the required instances agian.

# Spot Fleet

1. Spot Fleet are the set of spot instances and optionally On-Demand Instances.

2. The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price contraints.
    - Define possible launch pools instance types, OS, Availability Zones.
    - Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose.
    - Spot fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost.

3. Strategies to allocate Spot Instances
    - lowestPrice: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload.)
    - diversified: distributed across the pools (great for availability and long workloads.)
    - capacityOptimized: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances.
    - priceCapacityOptimized (recommended): pools with highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (best choice for  the most workloads).
