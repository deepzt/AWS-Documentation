# Health Checks in Route 53 - Notes

1. Overview of Health Checks in Route 53

- Health checks are used to monitor the health of public and private resources (e.g., load balancers, EC2 instances).
- Common use case: Multi-region setup for high availability, where health checks help ensure traffic is routed only to healthy regions.

2. Purpose of Health Checks

- Multi-region setup: Example: Two load balancers in different regions (e.g., us-east-1 and eu-west-1) running the same application.
- Routing Traffic: Route 53 DNS records (latency-based) route users to the closest healthy load balancer.
- Health checks ensure traffic isn't routed to an unhealthy region (e.g., if one load balancer fails).

3. Types of Health Checks

- Endpoint Health Check: Monitors public endpoints like application servers or AWS resources.
- Calculated Health Check: Combines the results of multiple child health checks into one parent health check.
- CloudWatch Alarm Health Check: Monitors a CloudWatch Alarm, useful for private resources.

4. Health Check Process

- AWS health checkers (around 15 globally) perform health checks by sending requests to public endpoints.
Health Check Criteria:
- If the health check gets a 200 OK response (or another defined status code), the endpoint is considered healthy.
- Threshold: A majority (18% or more) of health checkers must agree the endpoint is healthy for it to pass.
- Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP.
- Health Check Frequency:
    - Regular: Every 30 seconds (lower cost).
    - Fast Health Checks: Every 10 seconds (higher cost).
- Health checks also allow for text-based responses, where the first 5,120 bytes are checked for specific text.

5. Health Check Locations

- Health checkers come from multiple global locations.
- You can select specific locations from where to perform the checks.

6. Network Considerations for Health Checks

- Health checkers must be able to access the endpoint.
- Must allow incoming requests from Route 53 health checkers' IP address range.
- IP range for health checkers is available from AWS documentation.

7. Calculated Health Checks

- Allows combining the results of multiple health checks into a single "parent" health check.
- For example, monitoring multiple EC2 instances and combining their health status into one.

- Conditions for combining checks:
    AND: All child checks must pass for the parent to pass.
    OR: At least one child check must pass.
    NOT: A negation condition.
    Up to 256 child health checks can be combined.

8. Use Cases for Calculated Health Checks

- Useful for situations like performing maintenance on a website without triggering a failure on all checks.
- Example: If you want to ensure that a service passes only if certain EC2 instances are healthy (combining multiple EC2 health checks).

9. Monitoring Private Resources (e.g., VPC or On-premises)

- Public Route 53 health checkers cannot directly access private resources within a VPC.
- Solution: Use CloudWatch Metrics to monitor private resources.
- Assign a CloudWatch Alarm to the metric.
- When the alarm state is breached (indicating a failure), Route 53 marks the health check as unhealthy.
- Common Use Case: Monitoring the health of EC2 instances in a private subnet with CloudWatch.
