## Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) Overview

### Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Deploy, scale, and manage third-party network appliances in AWS.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Firewall
  - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
  - Deep Packet Inspection
  - Network-level payload modification

### Functionality

1. **Traffic Inspection**:
   - All network traffic is routed through the GWLB.
   - Traffic is inspected by third-party virtual appliances (e.g., EC2 instances).

2. **Traffic Flow**:
   - Users access applications through a load balancer (e.g., ALB).
   - Traffic is first routed to the GWLB.
   - GWLB distributes traffic to a target group of virtual appliances.
   - Appliances analyze traffic (e.g., firewall, IDPS).
   - If traffic is accepted, it is sent back to the GWLB.
   - GWLB forwards traffic to the application.

3. **Route Table Updates**:
   - VPC route tables are modified to route traffic through the GWLB.

### Technical Details

- **Layer 3 Operation**: Network layer for IP packets.

- **Functions**:
  - Transparent Network Gateway: Single entry and exit point for traffic in the VPC.
  - Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across virtual appliances in the target group.

### Protocols

- **GENEVE Protocol**: Used on port 6081 for GWLB.

### Target Groups

- **Third-Party Appliances**:
  - EC2 instances (registered by instance ID).
  - Private IP addresses (for appliances in your own data center).

### Exam Tips

- **Remember**:
  - GWLB for network traffic inspection and third-party appliance management.
  - Operates at Layer 3.
  - Uses GENEVE protocol on port 6081.
