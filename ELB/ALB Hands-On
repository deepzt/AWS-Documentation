# ALB Hands On Practice

1. Launching EC2 Instances:

    * Created two EC2 instances with Amazon Linux 2 and t2.micro instance type.
    * We dont need to set up SSH since we will not be using it.
    * Configured security groups to allow HTTP traffic.
    * Enter user data for installing web server and creating a default page "Hello World" for response.
    * Verified both instances by accessing their IPv4 addresses and receiving responses.

2. Creating an Application Load Balancer (ALB):

    * Chose ALB over other types (NLB for high-performance TCP/UDP, Gateway LB for security).
    * Named it DemoALB and set it to Internet-facing with IPv4 addressing.
    * For network mapping, deploy the ALB in available AZs.
    * Created a new security group allowing HTTP traffic.
    * Create a target group for the ALB, in this case its the pair of EC2 instances.
    

3. Setting Up Target Groups & Routing:

    * Created a Target Group (TG) named demo-tg-alb for HTTP traffic on port 80.
    * Registered both EC2 instances in the target group.
    * Linked the target group to the ALB's listener on port 80.
    * Created and provisioned the ALB successfully.

4. Testing Load Balancing:

    * Used ALBâ€™s DNS name to access the instances.
    * Refreshing the page showed responses switching between the two instances, proving load balancing.
    * Verified both instances were healthy in the Target Group dashboard.

5. Simulating Instance Failure & Recovery:

    * Stopped one instance and saw it marked as unhealthy in the target group.
    * ALB stopped routing traffic to it, proving automatic failover.
    * Restarted the instance, observed it becoming healthy again, and verified load balancing resumed.
