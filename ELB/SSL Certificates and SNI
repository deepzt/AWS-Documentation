## SSL and TLS Certificates Overview

### Key Concepts

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: Encrypts transfer connections.
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Newer version of SSL, commonly used.
- **In-Flight Encryption**: Encrypts data between clients and load balancers.

### SSL Certificates

- **Issued by Certificate Authorities**: Examples include Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt.
- **Purpose**: Encrypt connections between clients and load balancers.
- **Expiration**: Must be renewed regularly to maintain authenticity.

### Load Balancer Integration

1. **HTTPS Connections**:
   - Users connect over HTTPS to the load balancer.
   - Load balancer performs SSL certificate termination.
   - Backend communication can be HTTP (unencrypted) within the VPC.

2. **X.509 Certificates**:
   - Managed using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
   - Can upload custom certificates to ACM.
   - HTTPS listeners require a default certificate and can support multiple domains.

### Server Name Indication (SNI)

- **Purpose**: Allows multiple SSL certificates on one web server to serve multiple websites.
- **Function**: Client indicates the hostname during the initial SSL handshake.
- **Support**: Works with ALB, NLB, and CloudFront. Not supported by CLB.

### Example Scenario

1. **ALB with Multiple Domains**:
   - ALB has two target groups: `www.mycorp.com` and `Domain1.example.com`.
   - ALB uses SNI to load the correct SSL certificate based on the hostname.
   - Routes traffic to the appropriate target group.

### Supported Load Balancers

1. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**:
   - Supports only one SSL certificate.
   - For multiple hostnames, use multiple CLBs.

2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
   - Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates.
   - Uses SNI for hostname-based routing.

3. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:
   - Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates.
   - Uses SNI for hostname-based routing.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Set Up HTTPS Listener**:
   - Specify a default certificate.
   - Add optional certificates for multiple domains.

2. **Enable SNI**:
   - Ensure the load balancer supports SNI (ALB, NLB, or CloudFront).
   - Configure hostname-based routing rules.

### Exam Tips

- **Remember**:
  - SSL/TLS for in-flight encryption.
  - SNI for multiple SSL certificates on one load balancer.
  - ALB and NLB support multiple certificates using SNI.
  - CLB supports only one certificate.
  
- **Configuration**: Know how to set up HTTPS listeners and manage SSL certificates in AWS.
