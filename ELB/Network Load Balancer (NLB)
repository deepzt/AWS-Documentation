## Network Load Balancer (NLB) Overview

### Key Characteristics

- **Layer 4 Load Balancer**: Handles TCP and UDP traffic.
- **High Performance**: 
  - Can manage millions of requests per second.
  - Ultra-low latency.
- **Static IPs**: 
  - One static IP per availability zone.
  - Can assign elastic IPs to each AZ.
- **AWS Free Tier**: Not included.

### Use Cases

- **Extreme Performance**: Suitable for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.
- **Static IPs**: Ideal for applications needing exposure through a set of static IPs.
- **TCP/UDP Traffic**: Best choice for handling TCP or UDP traffic.

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Target Groups**:
   - Can include EC2 instances or hardcoded private IP addresses.
   - Supports backend servers in your data center.
   
2. **Combining with ALB**:
   - NLB can be placed in front of an ALB.
   - Provides fixed IPs and advanced HTTP handling rules.

### Health Checks

- **Supported Protocols**: TCP, HTTP, HTTPS.
- **Configuration**: Define health checks based on the supported protocols for backend applications.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Create Target Groups**:
   - Define target groups for the NLB.
   - Register EC2 instances or private IP addresses in the target groups.

2. **Redirect Traffic**:
   - NLB redirects TCP or UDP traffic to the target groups.
   - Can use TCP traffic on the frontend and HTTP on the backend.

3. **Static IP Assignment**:
   - Assign elastic IPs to each availability zone for static IP exposure.

4. **Health Checks**:
   - Configure health checks using TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS protocols to ensure backend application health.

### Exam Tips

- **Remember**: 
  - NLB for TCP/UDP traffic.
  - Static IPs for applications.
  - High performance and low latency.
  - NLB in front of ALB for fixed IPs and HTTP handling rules.
