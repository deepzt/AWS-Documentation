## Cross Zone Load Balancing Overview

### Key Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Distribute traffic evenly across all registered instances in all availability zones (AZs).

- **Behavior**:
  - With cross zone load balancing: Traffic is evenly distributed across all instances in all AZs.
  - Without cross zone load balancing: Traffic is distributed within each AZ, potentially causing imbalance if instances are unevenly distributed.

### Example Scenario

1. **With Cross Zone Load Balancing**:
   - Two AZs: AZ1 with 2 EC2 instances, AZ2 with 8 EC2 instances.
   - Client sends 50% of traffic to each ALB instance.
   - Each ALB instance distributes traffic evenly across all 10 EC2 instances (10% each).

2. **Without Cross Zone Load Balancing**:
   - Client sends 50% of traffic to each AZ.
   - Each ALB instance distributes traffic only within its AZ.
   - Instances in AZ1 receive 25% of traffic each, instances in AZ2 receive 6.25% each.

### Load Balancer Types and Cross Zone Load Balancing

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
   - Enabled by default.
   - No charges for inter-AZ data transfers.
   - Can be disabled at the target group level.

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:
   - Disabled by default.
   - Enabling incurs charges for inter-AZ data transfers.

3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**:
   - Disabled by default.
   - Enabling incurs charges for inter-AZ data transfers.

4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**:
   - Disabled by default.
   - Enabling does not incur charges for inter-AZ data transfers.
   - Note: CLB is being retired and may not be relevant for future use.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Enable/Disable Cross Zone Load Balancing**:
   - Go to the load balancer attributes in the AWS Management Console.
   - Edit the attributes to turn cross zone load balancing on or off.

2. **ALB Specific Configuration**:
   - Cross zone load balancing is on by default.
   - Can be overridden at the target group level.

### Exam Tips

- **Remember**:
  - Cross zone load balancing distributes traffic evenly across all instances in all AZs.
  - Default settings vary by load balancer type (ALB, NLB, GWLB, CLB).
  - Charges for inter-AZ data transfers depend on the load balancer type and configuration.
  
- **Configuration**: Know how to enable and configure cross zone load balancing in the AWS Management Console.
