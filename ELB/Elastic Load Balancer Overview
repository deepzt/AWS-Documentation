# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

1. A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers (EC2 instances in AWS) to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
2. When users connect to the load balancer, it routes traffic to different backend servers based on specific algorithms and health checks.

# Types of Load Balancers in AWS:

1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Older generation, supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL protocols.
2. Application Load Balancer (ALB): Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols. Best for web applications.
3. Network Load Balancer (NLB): Supports TCP, TLS, and UDP protocols. Ideal for high-performance and low-latency applications.
4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): Operates at the network layer, suited for network appliances.

# Key Benefits:

1. Single Point of Access: Users connect to a single endpoint provided by the load balancer.
2. High Availability: Automatically handles failures of backend servers.
3. SSL Termination: Manages SSL/TLS encryption and decryption.
4. Health Checks: Monitors the health of backend servers and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
5. Scalability: Easily integrates with other AWS services for automatic scaling and management.

# Security:

1. Public Access: Allows users to connect via HTTP or HTTPS.
2. Internal Traffic: Ensures that only traffic from the load balancer reaches the backend servers using security group rules.
