# AMI Overview

1. AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image
2. AMI is a customization of an EC2 Instance where we can add our own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring and more.
3. It allows the EC2 instance to have faster load timing as the software are pre packaged.
4. AMIs can be build for a specific region and can be copied across regions.
5. EC2 instances can be fired up from either AWS AMIs or your own AMIs which you maintain.
6. Additionally there are AMIs in AWS Marketplace.

# Use Case

Create an AMI which has httpd service installed and use it to create a simple webpage in another instance.

1. Let's fire up an EC2 instance with user data to install httpd service for apache server and enable it.
2. Next we create an AMI. For doing this, we right click on the instance and go to `image and template` and `create image` 
3. Navigate to AMIs on left panel to launch an instance using the AMI or go to the instance tab and navigate to `Application and OS Images` and `My AMIs`.
