# Elastic File System (EFS)

1. EFS is a managed network file system that can be mounted on many EC2 .
2. It works with EC2 instances in multiple AZs.
3. Highly available and expensive, pay per use.

# Use Cases of EFS 

1. It can be used for content management, data sharing, web serving, Wordpress.
2. Uses NFSv4.1 protocol.
3. The EFS uses security group for access.
4. Compatible with Linux based AMIs(not Windows).
5. It can be used with encryption at rest.
6. The file system scales automatically and uses pay-per-use.

# Some features of EFS

1. 1000s of consurrent NFS clients, 10GB+ /s throughput.
2. Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically.
3. We can set performance mode for EFS at the creation time
    - General Purpose (default): latency sensitive use cases (web server, CMS etc.).
    - Max I/O: High latency, throughput (big data, media proocessing).
4. The throughput mode of the EFS are:
    - Bursting: 1 TB = 50MB/s + burst upto 100MB/s
    - Provisioned: Set your throughput regardless of storage size.
    - Elastic: automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads.

# EFS Storage Classes

1. Storage Tier(Storage Lifecycle Management feature):
    - Standard : for frequently access files.
    - Infrequently accessed (EFS IA): Cost to retrieve files but lower price to store.
    - Archive: Rarely accessed data. 

2. Implement lifecycle policies to move files between storage tiers.
3. Can be created within a Region across multiple AZs or One zone(One AZs).
