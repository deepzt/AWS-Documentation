# EBS Volume 

1. EBS Stands for Elastic Block Store which is a network drive.
2. It allows instance data to persists even after termination.
3. It can be mounted to only one instance at a time.
4. They are bound to specific availability zones.

# Properties

1. Since it is a network drive, it can be detached and attached to other EC2 instances.
2. There can be a bit of latency.
3. It is locked to an Availability Zone which means if it is created in us-east-1a, it cannot be attached to us-east-1b.
4. But to move a volume across, we first need to snapshot it.
5. We need to provision the capacity i.e size in GBs and I/O per second (IOPS).

# Exam Case Scenario

1. We can enable or disable the deletion of EBS volume on termination of EC2 instance.
2. By default the root EBS volume is set to delete after termination.
3. The use case can be to preserve the root volume when instance is terminated.
