# EBS Encryption

1. When we create an EBS Volume, we get the following features:
- Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.
- All the data in flight moving between the instances and the volume is encrypted.
- All the snapshots will be encrypted.
- All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted.

2. All the encryption and decryption are handled transparently.
3. Encryption has a minimal impact on latency.
4. EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256).
5. Snapshot of an unencrypted volume is unencrypted.
6. Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption.
7. Snapshot of encrypted volumes are also encrypted. 

You can encrypt an unencrypted snapshot on the fly by using `Create volume from snapshot` option in the `Actions` tab.
