# Local EC2 Instance Store 

This type of storage is temporary high-performance harware disk (attached to physical server)

Few points to remember are:

1. If you terminate the instance, the instance store attached to the instance will also lose the storage.
2. It has better I/O operations per second. (can reach upto 3 million IOPS)
3. Good for buffer, cache and temporary storage.
4. There is no additional cost to it. It is included in the cost of instance charge.
