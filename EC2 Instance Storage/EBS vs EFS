# Difference between EBS and EFS

1. EBS volumes can be attached to one EC2 instance at a time (Except the io1 and io2 multi attach instances).
2. EBS volumes are locked to an Availability Zone.
3. For gp2 EBS instances, IO increases if the disk size increases.
4. For gp3 and io1, we can increase the IO independently.
5. To migrate an EBS volume across AZ, we need to take a snapshot, and we can restore the snapshot in another AZ.
6. For the deletion of the EC2 instance, the root EBS volume also get deleted, but it can be configured while creating the EC2 instance.


1. The EFS volume is the network files systems that can be attached to 100s of instances concurrently.
2. It is only used with Linux Instances.
3. EFS costs higher than the EBS.
4. We can leverage storage tiers for cost saving and storage lifecycle management.
