# RDS Overview

1. What is AWS RDS?

RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service for deploying SQL-based databases in the cloud.
Supports multiple database engines that use SQL as a query language.

2. Supported Database Engines:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- IBM DB2
- Amazon Aurora (AWS's proprietary database)

3. Advantages of Using RDS vs. Self-Managed Databases:

- Fully Managed Service by AWS.
- Automated Provisioning of databases.
- Automated OS Patching (No need for manual updates).
- Continuous Backups and ability for Point-in-Time Restore.
- Performance Monitoring with dashboards.
- Read Replicas for better read performance.
- Multi-AZ setup for disaster recovery.
- Maintenance Windows for upgrades.

4. Scaling Capabilities:

- Vertical Scaling: Increase instance type.
- Horizontal Scaling: Add read replicas.
- EBS-backed Storage: Scalable and reliable.

5. Limitations of RDS:

No SSH Access to the underlying EC2 instances (AWS manages the infrastructure).

6. RDS Storage Auto Scaling:

- Automatically scales storage when nearing capacity.
- Auto Scaling Conditions:
- Free storage falls below 10% of allocated capacity.
- Low storage condition persists for 5 minutes.
- 6 hours must have passed since the last modification.
- Threshold Setting: Set maximum storage limits to avoid infinite growth.
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads.
- Supported by all RDS database engines.

7. Key Benefits of RDS Storage Auto Scaling:

- No need for manual storage management.
- Automatically expands storage when required, preventing service disruptions.
