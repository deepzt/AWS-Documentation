# Read Replicas

1. RDS Read Replicas:

**Purpose**: Scale read operations, not for write operations.

**How It Works**:

- Asynchronous Replication: Data is replicated from the master database to the replicas, meaning data is eventually consistent.
- Can create up to 15 Read Replicas.
- Options for replicas:
- Same Availability Zone (AZ)
- Cross Availability Zone
- Cross Region
- Promoting Read Replicas: A Read Replica can be promoted to its own database, becoming independent of the replication.

**Use Case**: Commonly used for offloading read-heavy workloads, like running reporting or analytics on the replica without affecting the main production database.
Only Read Operations: Can only handle SELECT queries (reading data). Write operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE are not allowed on Read Replicas.

**Networking Costs**:
Replication within the same region (different AZs) is free for AWS managed services.
Cross-region replication incurs network fees.

2. Classic Use Case for Read Replicas:
Example: If a reporting application is added to a production database, it might slow down performance. Instead, create a Read Replica for the reporting app to read data without affecting the main database.

# RDS Multi AZ 

3. RDS Multi-AZ:

**Purpose**: Primarily for Disaster Recovery.

**How It Works**:

    - Synchronous Replication: Changes made to the master instance are immediately replicated to the standby instance in a different AZ.
    - Automatic Failover: If the master instance fails, the standby instance is automatically promoted to master with no manual intervention.
    - The application always uses the same DNS name, so failover is seamless without needing to update the appâ€™s connection settings.
    - No Scaling: Unlike Read Replicas, Multi-AZ is not used to scale reads; the standby database is inactive and only serves as a backup.
    - Failover Scenarios:
    AZ failure, instance failure, or storage failure of the master instance triggers the failover to the standby.
    
4. Can Read Replicas be Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery?
Yes, Read Replicas can be configured as Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery.
This is a common exam topic.

5. Switching from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ:
- Zero Downtime Operation: You can enable Multi-AZ for a database without stopping it.

**How It Works**:

- Modify the database settings to enable Multi-AZ.
- Automatic Snapshot of the master database is taken.
- A standby database is restored and synchronized with the master.
- No downtime during this process.
