# RDS Custom

1. Overview of RDS Custom

- RDS (Relational Database Service) does not allow access to the underlying OS or customization.
- RDS Custom, however, does allow customization.
- It supports only two database types:
    - Oracle
    - Microsoft SQL Server

2. Features of RDS Custom
- Provides access to the operating system (OS) and database customization.
- Maintains benefits of RDS, including automated setup, operations, and scaling in AWS.
- Unlike standard RDS, RDS Custom allows:
- Configuration of internal settings
- Installation of patches
- Enabling native features
- SSH/SSM access to the underlying EC2 instance

3. Customization Process
- To perform customizations:
- Deactivate automation mode to prevent AWS from interfering during modifications.
- Take a database snapshot before making changes to avoid irreversible errors.
