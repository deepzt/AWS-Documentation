# Aurora Advanced Concepts 

1. Replica Auto-Scaling:

When to Use: When there are many read requests, and CPU usage is high on the reader endpoint, replica auto-scaling is useful.

# How It Works:

- Aurora automatically adds more replicas.
- The reader endpoint expands to include these new replicas.
- Traffic is distributed across replicas to reduce CPU load and balance the read traffic more efficiently.

2. Custom Endpoints:

- Use Case: For environments where there are multiple types of read replicas, such as instances with different sizes (e.g., DB.R3 large vs DB.R5 2Xlarge).

# How It Works:

- Define custom endpoints for a subset of replicas (e.g., more powerful replicas).
- Custom endpoints allow specific workloads (e.g., analytical queries) to target more powerful replicas, improving performance.

- After defining custom endpoints, the reader endpoint may no longer be used.
This enables flexible routing of traffic based on workload requirements.

3. Aurora Serverless:

Use Case: Ideal for workloads that are infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable, where you donâ€™t need to do capacity planning.

# How It Works:

- Auto-scaling of Aurora instances based on actual usage.
- Pay-per-second billing for the Aurora instances used.
- No capacity planning required.
- A proxy fleet managed by Aurora connects the client to the appropriate resources.
- The database scales up or down automatically based on workload.

4. Global Aurora:

- Use Case: For cross-region replication and disaster recovery purposes.

- Global Database:

    - One primary region where all writes and reads happen.
    - Up to five secondary read-only regions.
    - Replication is typically under 1 second between regions.

- Failover: In case of a database outage, you can promote a secondary region to be read/write with an RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of less than 1 minute.
Read Scaling: Helps decrease latency for global read workloads.

5. Machine Learning Integration:

- Aurora and Machine Learning:
Aurora integrates with AWS machine learning services such as SageMaker and Amazon Comprehend.
- SageMaker: Use any machine learning model to perform operations like fraud detection or product recommendations.
Amazon Comprehend: For sentiment analysis.
No ML Expertise Required: The integration allows applications to use machine learning features through simple SQL queries.

- Use Case:

- Fraud detection: Detect fraudulent transactions.
- Ads targeting: Improve ad targeting using user data.
- Product recommendations: Suggest products to users based on historical data.

- How It Works:

Aurora sends data (e.g., user profile, shopping history) to machine learning services via SQL queries.
ML service returns predictions (e.g., recommended products) to Aurora, which then sends the results back to the application.

6. Key Features to Remember:

- Replica Auto-Scaling: Automatically scale read replicas based on traffic.
- Custom Endpoints: Route traffic to specific subsets of replicas based on workload.
- Aurora Serverless: On-demand, auto-scaling databases with pay-per-second billing for intermittent workloads.
- Global Aurora: Supports cross-region replication for disaster recovery and global read scaling.
- Machine Learning Integration: Aurora integrates with AWS ML services for predictions, recommendations, and sentiment analysis.
