# Public IP

1. Public IP means machine can be identified on the Internet.
2. Must be unique across the whole web.
3. It can be geo-located easily.

# Private IP

1. Private IP means the machine can only be identified in the private network only.
2. The IP must be unique across the private network.
3. BUT two different private networks can have same IPs.
4. Machines connect to internet using a NAT + internet gateway (proxy).
5. Only specified range of IPs can be used as private IPs.

# Elastic IP

1. When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP.
2. If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need to have an Elastic IP.
3. An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IPyou can own as long as you dont delete it.
4. You can attach it one instance at a time.
5. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your acount.
6. YOu can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account. (can be increased)
7. It is not a good practice to use Elastic IP.
    - They often reflec poor architectural decision.
    - Instead we can use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it.
    - Or a Load Balancer adn dont use a public IP at all.
