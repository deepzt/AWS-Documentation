# Placement Groups

Placement Groups helps to have more control over the EC2 Instances placement strategy.

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html]

Overall there are 3 type of Placement Groups

- Cluster - group of instances in a low latency network in a single AZ.

    - 10 Gbps bandwidth between instances with Enhanced Networking enabled
    - If the AZ fails, it fails at the same time.

- Spread - spreads instances across underlying hardware. (max 7 instances per group per AZ).

    - Can span across multiple AZ.
    - reduced risk of simultaneous failure.
    - Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group.
    - Good for high availability.

- Partition - spreads instances over different partition within an AZ. (scales to 100 instances per group)

    - Upto 100s of EC2 instances 
    - The partition do not share racks with the instances in other partition.
    - EC2 instances get access to the partition information from metadata.
