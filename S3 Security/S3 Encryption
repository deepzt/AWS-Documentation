# S3 Object Encryption

- We can encrypt objects in S3 using 4 methods
    - Server Side Encryption (SSE)
        - SSE with Amazon managed S3 keys (default)
            * Encryption using keys which are handled and managed by AWS
            * Object is encrypted server side with AES-256
            * Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"

        - SSE with KMS key stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
            * Encryption using keys which are handled and managed by KMS (Key Management Service)
            * KMS advantage: user control and audit key usage using Cloudtrail
            * Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"

        - SSE with Customer provided Keys (SSE-C)
            * Uses Customer managed key
            * AWS do not store or encrypt the key
            * HTTPS is must
    
    - Client Side Encryption
        * Encrypt before sending data
        * Decrypt before retrieving data
        * Customer fully manages the key and encryption cycle.
