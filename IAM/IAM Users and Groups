IAM or Identity and Access Management is a Global service.
We create users and assign them to groups.

Root account -> Only used to setup the account.
It is a secure practice to create IAM users and groups and assign them permission.

Groups contains users and NOT other groups.
A user can be in multiple groups.
But it is not mandatory for a user to be in groups. Some users can be independent the groups. 

The need for creating users and groups is to allow them to use the AWS account.
We set permissions for those groups or users to have certain access in the account.

Ther Users and groups are assigned with permissions through a JSON document called IAM Policy.
These policies defines permissions for the users and groups.
It's best pratice to apply Least Privilege Principle for any users for security reasons.
