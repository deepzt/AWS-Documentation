IAM or Identity and Access Management is a Global service.
We create users and assign them to groups.

Root account created in AWS is default user and should only be used to setup the account.
It is a secure practice to create users in IAM and addign them to groups.

Groups can only contain users and not other groups.
All users not necessarily belong to a group.
A user can be in multiple groups.

The need for creating users and groups is to allow them to use the AWS account.
We set permissions for the groups or accounts to have certain access in the account.

Users and groups can be assigned JSON document called IAM Policies.
These policies define the permission for the users and groups.
It's best pratice to apply Least Privilege Principle.
