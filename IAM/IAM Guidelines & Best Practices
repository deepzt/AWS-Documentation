# Points to Remember in IAM

1. Don't use the Root account except for AWS account setup.
2. One physical user = One AWS user
3. Assign users to groups and ssign permissions to groups
4. Create a strong **password policy**
5. Use and enforce the use of **MFA**.
6. Create and use **Roles** for giving permissions to AWS services.
7. Use Access Keys for programmatic access.
8. Audit the permissions of the account using **IAM Credentials** Report and **IAM Access Advisor**.
