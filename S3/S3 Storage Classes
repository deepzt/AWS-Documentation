# Overview of Storage Classes:

* Amazon S3 Standard (General Purpose)
* Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (IA)
* Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)
* Amazon S3 Glacier
* Glacier Instant Retrieval
* Glacier Flexible Retrieval
* Glacier Deep Archive
* Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

# Durability & Availability:

- Durability:
    All storage classes have 11 nines durability (99.999999999%).
    High durability: For example, with 10 million objects, you may lose one every 10,000 years.

- Availability:
    Represents how accessible a service is, and depends on the storage class.
    Example:
    S3 Standard: 99.99% availability, about 53 minutes of downtime per year.
    S3 Standard-IA: 99.9% availability.
    One Zone-IA: 99.5% availability.

# Storage Classes in Detail:

- Amazon S3 Standard:
    For frequently accessed data.
    Low latency, high throughput.
    Use cases: Big data analytics, mobile apps, gaming, content distribution.
    Availability: 99.99% (2 concurrent AWS facility failures possible).

- Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (IA):
    For less frequently accessed data but needs rapid retrieval when accessed.
    Availability: 99.9%.
    Use case: Disaster recovery and backups.
    Lower cost than S3 Standard but incurs retrieval cost.

- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA):
    Stored in a single availability zone (AZ).
    Availability: 99.5%.
    Durability within a single AZ.
    Use case: Secondary backups of on-premises data or recreatable data.

- Amazon S3 Glacier (Cold Storage):
    Low-cost, archival storage.
    Retrieval costs and storage costs.

- Classes within Glacier:
    * Glacier Instant Retrieval: For data accessed once a quarter with milliseconds retrieval.
    * Glacier Flexible Retrieval: Expedited (1-5 min), Standard (3-5 hours), Bulk (5-12 hours).
    * Glacier Deep Archive: Cheapest for long-term storage with 12-48 hours retrieval.

- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering:
    Automatically moves objects between different access tiers based on usage patterns.
    No retrieval charges.

- Tiers:
    Frequent Access (default).
    Infrequent Access (not accessed for 30 days).
    Archive Instant Access (not accessed for 90+ days).
    Archive Access (not accessed for 90-700+ days).
    Deep Archive Access (not accessed for 180-700+ days).

- Cost Considerations:
    Each class has varying pricing, mainly based on:
    Storage cost.
    Retrieval cost (for Glacier and IA).
    The Intelligent Tiering class adds a small monthly monitoring fee and auto-tiering fee.
