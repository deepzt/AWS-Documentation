# S3 Storage Classes

1. S3 Standard is for frequently accessed data with low-latency needs.

    - High durability (99.999999999%)
    - Low latency and high throughput
    - Used for websites, big data analytics, and mobile applications

2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is for data that has unknown or changing access patterns (e.g., unpredictable usage).

    - Optimizes costs by automatically moving data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access).
    - Best for data with unknown or changing access patterns.

3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) is cheaper than Standard but incurs retrieval costs. Best for data you access infrequently but need immediate availability.

    - Lower cost than S3 Standard
    - Retrieval charges apply.
    - S3 One Zone-IA: Lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data that doesnâ€™t need high availability across multiple zones.


4. S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive are for archival storage with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours, at a lower cost.

    - Used for compliance and regulatory archiving.
    - S3 Outposts: S3 storage on-premises for hybrid cloud applications using AWS Outposts.
