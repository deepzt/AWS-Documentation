# S3 Versioning

Versioning in Amazon S3 allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket.

# How it works: 

- When you upload a new version of an object, S3 doesnâ€™t overwrite the previous version but stores both versions. This allows you to recover earlier versions if needed.

# Benefits:

- Protects against accidental deletions or overwrites.
- Allows for easy recovery of previous object versions.
# Enabling Versioning: 

- To enable versioning, it must be activated on the bucket. Once enabled, all objects uploaded to that bucket will have versions.

# Example of Versioning:

If you upload an object file.txt, it has a version ID v1. If you upload a new version, it gets a new version ID v2, while v1 still exists.
