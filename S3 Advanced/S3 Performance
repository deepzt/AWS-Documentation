# S3 Baseline Performance - Key Notes

1. Default S3 Performance Characteristics

- Automatic Scaling:
    - S3 scales to handle very high numbers of requests automatically.
- Latency:
    - Low latency with 100â€“200 milliseconds to get the first byte out of S3.

2. Request Limits Per Prefix

- PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE Requests:
    - Up to 3,500 requests per second per prefix.
- GET/HEAD Requests:
    - Up to 5,500 requests per second per prefix.
- Definition of a Prefix:
    - The portion of the key name between the bucket name and the file name.
- Example: For an object located at base/folder1/sub1/file, the prefix is /folder1/sub1.
- Scaling Performance:
    - Multiple prefixes can be used to scale the overall throughput.
- Even distribution across prefixes can achieve higher combined request rates (e.g., 22,000 GET/HEAD requests per second across four prefixes).

3. Performance Optimization Strategies

- Multi-Part Upload:

    - Usage: Recommended for files over 100 MB; mandatory for files over 5 GB.
    - Benefit: Uploads are divided into smaller chunks which are uploaded in parallel, maximizing bandwidth and speeding up transfers.
    - Mechanism: S3 reassembles the parts into a complete file after all parts are uploaded.

- S3 Transfer Acceleration:

    - Purpose: Increases transfer speeds for uploads and downloads.
    - Mechanism:
    - Files are transferred to an AWS edge location, which then uses the fast, private AWS network to forward the data to the target S3 bucket in another region.
    - Reduces reliance on the slower public internet.
    - Compatibility: Works together with multi-part uploads.

- S3 Byte Range Fetches:

    - Purpose: Optimizes file downloads by parallelizing GET requests for specific byte ranges of a file.
    - Benefits:
        - Speeds up large file downloads by requesting parts concurrently.
        - Provides resilience, allowing retries on smaller byte ranges in case of failure.
        - Useful for fetching specific parts of a file (e.g., file header).

4. Summary

- Baseline Performance:
    - S3 offers excellent baseline performance with low latency and high request handling per prefix.
- Optimizations:
    - Multi-part upload and transfer acceleration enhance upload speeds.
    - Byte range fetches optimize download performance and allow for partial retrieval of files.
- Scalability:
    - Using multiple prefixes allows further scaling to accommodate high throughput.
    - These notes capture the key points on how Amazon S3 handles performance, the inherent request limits per prefix, and the strategies available to optimize upload and download speeds.
