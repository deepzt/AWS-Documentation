# Notes on S3 Requester Pays

1. Overview of S3 Requester Pays:

- Requester Pays is a feature where the requester (the user downloading the file) pays for the networking costs instead of the bucket owner.

2. Bucket Owner's Responsibility:

- The bucket owner pays for the storage costs of objects in the bucket.
- The networking costs for data transfer are typically borne by the bucket owner, but with Requester Pays, the requester covers the download costs.

3. When to Use Requester Pays:

- Useful when sharing large datasets with other users or accounts.
- Instead of the owner incurring high data transfer costs for large files, the requester is billed for the download.

4. Requester Conditions:

- The requester must be authenticated in AWS (i.e., not anonymous) to ensure proper billing.
- AWS tracks the authenticated requester's actions and bills them accordingly.

5. Exam Relevance:

S3 Requester Pays may be tested in scenarios, so it's important to understand when and how itâ€™s used.
