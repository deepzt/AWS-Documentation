# Notes on Moving Objects Between Storage Classes

1. Transitioning Between Storage Classes:

- Objects can move between different storage classes, as shown in the diagram:
  - Standard → Standard IA → Intelligent Tiering → One-Zone IA.
  - One-Zone IA → Flexible Retrieval → Deep Archive.
- This allows optimization based on access frequency and archival needs.

2. Storage Class Strategy:

Standard IA: For objects that are infrequently accessed.
Glacier/Deep Archive: For archived objects.

3. Automating Transitions with Lifecycle Rules:

Transition Action: Automatically move objects between classes after a specified time.
  Example: Move to Standard IA after 60 days, or Glacier after six months.

Expiration Action: Automatically delete objects after a specified time.
  Example: Delete access logs after 365 days or delete old versions if versioning is enabled.

Multi-part Upload Expiry: Delete incomplete uploads older than 2 weeks.

4. Lifecycle Rules Configuration:

Rules can be set based on:
- Prefix (e.g., apply to specific paths in a bucket).
- Object tags (e.g., apply only to "finance" tagged objects).
- Entire bucket or specific objects.
